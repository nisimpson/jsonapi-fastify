## Bugfixes

- Fixed validation on create and update resource requests. The expected behavior for create and update request documents
  better reflect expectations expressed in the JSON:API 1.0 specification.

## Chores

- Updated package.json to only include distribution files, license, and markdown (README, CHANGELOG)

- Fixed serverless example handler
